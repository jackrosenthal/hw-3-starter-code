Homework 3: Lambda Calculus Beta Reducer
========================================

The purpose of this assignment is to:

1. Implement the fundamental algorithms of the lambda calculus
2. Practice symbolic computation in Racket

Getting Started
---------------

Open up "hw-3.rkt" in either Dr. Racket or another s-expression aware editor.
See the slides for recommendations on how to make Vim or EMACS easier to work
with Lisp dialects.

Unlike the previous assignment, your may use any functionality from the Racket
programming language you wish.

You will want to replace the parts of the code that say ``(todo)``.

You can define any helper functions your code needs.

Running your Code
-----------------

If you are using Dr. Racket, you can run your code by clicking "Run" and
entering expressions into the REPL at the bottom.

If you are using Racket from another editor, type "racket" at your terminal to
get a REPL. You can enter into your code using the following command::

   (enter! "hw-3.rkt")

Run any commands you need. To reload, you can type the same ``enter!`` command
again.

Note: the grader will run additional test cases from the ones you were given.
Please be sure to test all of your code.

Submitting your Code
--------------------

1. Make sure all code for your submission is committed.

2. Double check that step 1 is *actually* complete.

3. Tag your submission using Git::

      $ git tag submission

4. Type::

      $ git push origin --tags
